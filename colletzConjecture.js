//! Collatz Conjecture (3n+1)

// The Collatz conjecture (also known as 3n+1 conjecture) is a conjecture that applying the following algorithm to any number we will always eventually reach one:

// [This is writen in pseudocode]
// if(number is even) number = number / 2
// if(number is odd) number = 3*number + 1
// #Task

// Your task is to make a function hotpo that takes a positive n as input and returns the number of times you need to perform this algorithm to get n = 1.

// #Examples

// hotpo(1) returns 0
// (1 is already 1)

// hotpo(5) returns 5
// 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

// hotpo(6) returns 8
// 6 -> 3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

var hotpo = function (n) {
  if (n == 0) return 0;
  let counter = 0;
  while (n > 1) {
    n = n % 2 ? 3 * n + 1 : n / 2;
    counter++;
  }
  return counter;
};
